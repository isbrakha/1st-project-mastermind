# Mastermind
Mastermind is a famous tabletop game invented in the 70's by Mordechai Meirowitz, a postmaster and telecomunications expert!
It's a two player game where one player, (the code-maker) makes up a code, and the other player (the code-breaker) has to decypher it.
In this version of the game the computer will take the role of the code-maker and the user will take the role of the code-breaker.
